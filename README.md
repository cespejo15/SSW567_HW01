# SSW567 HW01
Think back to your elementary school geometry class where you learned about scalene, isosceles, equilateral, and right triangles.  Recall that:

equilateral triangles have all three sides with the same length
isosceles triangles have two sides with the same length
scalene triangles have three sides with different lengths
right triangles have three sides with lengths, a, b, and c where a2 + b2 = c2
Your assignment is to write a program in Python to classify triangles and use an automated test platform, e.g. UnitTest or PyTest, and write test cases to test your implementation of classifying triangles.  The goal is for you to gain experience using automated test tools and to think through the issues associated with testing a "system".  

These are your Requirements Specifications for this program:

“Write a function classify_triangle() that takes three  parameters: a, b, and c. The three parameters represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function returns a string that specifies whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral, and whether it is a right triangle as well.”

Hint:  Write a function called classify_triangle(a, b, c) where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangles.   You may either allow the user to enter values that you pass to classify_triangle() or your "main" routine can just invoke classify_triangle() with values.   This approach allows you to easily invoke classify_triangle() from your test framework.

You will not be graded on how well you write the program, but do try to do a decent job.  You may want to include a few bugs in your program to demonstrate that your test script is working properly and is able to find problems.

You'll find a partial solution in Canvas to show how to use Python's UnitTest framework.   Your solution should be managed using GitHub within a new repository created just for this assignment.

Assignment Deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Upload the file(s) with Python source code for your classify triangle solution to Canvas.  The file(s) should include the source code used to solve the problem and the test cases for the code.  Your test cases should demonstrate that you've adequately tested your solution. 

Deliverable 2: Upload a text file or screen shot to show the input and output of running the program and demonstrating that your program has been adequately tested.

Deliverable 3: Describe your experience with this assignment, specifically:

What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 
What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
Deliverable 4: Submit the URL of the GitHub repo containing your complete solution.   The files in the repo should match what you have uploaded to Canvas.
